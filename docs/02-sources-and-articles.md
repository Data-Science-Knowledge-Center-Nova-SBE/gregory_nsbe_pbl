# Sources and Articles

Some core concepts before we start, we use the term **Article** to refer to both science papers published in journals and news articles in other sources.

A **Source** is any website from where we can extract articles.

A **Subject** is a group of Sources and their respective articles. 

A **Category** is a group of articles whose title matches at least one keyword in a list for terms for the category. Categories can include articles across subjects.

## About Subjects and Categories



There are options to filter lists of articles by their category or subject in the format `articles/category/<category>` and `articles/subject/<subject>` where <category> and <subject> is the lowercase name with spaces replaced by dashes.
